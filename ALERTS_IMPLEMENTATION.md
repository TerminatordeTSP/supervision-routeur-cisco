# Alerts App Implementation

I have successfully created a comprehensive alerts application for the router supervision system. Here's what has been implemented:

## 📁 File Structure Created

        ├── check_alerts.py        # Command to check thresholds
        └── create_sample_alerts.py # Create sample data

```

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Alert Models**
- **AlertRule**: Defines threshold conditions that trigger alerts
- **Alert**: Individual alert instances when thresholds are exceeded  
- **AlertHistory**: Tracks status changes and user actions

### 2. **Alert Rules Management**
- Create, edit, and delete alert rules
- Support for CPU, RAM, and Traffic metrics
- Configurable thresholds and conditions (>, >=, <, <=)
- Email notification settings
- Active/inactive rule status

### 3. **Alert Dashboard**
- View all alerts with filtering (status, severity, search)
- Statistics overview (total, active, acknowledged, resolved, critical)
- Pagination for large alert lists
- Status badges and severity indicators

### 4. **Alert Actions**
- **Acknowledge**: Mark alert as seen but not resolved
- **Resolve**: Mark alert as fixed
- **Email Resend**: Manually resend alert notifications
- Comment system for tracking actions

### 5. **Email Notifications**
- Automatic email sending when alerts are triggered
- HTML and plain text email templates
- Configurable recipient lists
- Integration with existing SMTP settings

### 6. **Visual Design**
- Consistent with existing app styling (orange theme, dark background)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Status badges and severity colors
- Modern card-based layout

## 🔧 Configuration Added

### Settings Updated
```python
# Added to INSTALLED_APPS
'alerts_app',

# Email configuration (already existed)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'alerts@telecom-sudparis.eu'
```

### URLs Added
```python
# Added to main urls.py
path('alerts/', include('alerts_app.urls')),
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Alert Rules**
- Users create rules defining when alerts should trigger
- Example: "CPU Usage > 80%" 
- Rules can be active/inactive and have email notifications

### 2. **Threshold Checking**
- Management command `check_alerts` monitors current metrics
- Compares against alert rule thresholds
- Creates new alerts when thresholds are exceeded
- Only one active alert per rule/router combination

### 3. **Email Notifications**
- Emails sent automatically when alerts are created
- Recipients: rule-specific emails + router users
- HTML and text formats supported
- Resend capability for failed emails

### 4. **Alert Lifecycle**
1. **Active**: Alert just triggered
2. **Acknowledged**: User has seen the alert
3. **Resolved**: Issue has been fixed

## 📋 Next Steps

### To Complete Setup:

1. **Run Migrations** (when Django environment is ready):
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations alerts_app
python manage.py migrate
```

2. **Create Sample Data**:
```bash
python manage.py create_sample_alerts
```

3. **Set Up Periodic Checking**:
```bash
# Add to crontab for periodic threshold checking
*/5 * * * * python manage.py check_alerts
```

### Usage:

1. **Access Alert Dashboard**: `/alerts/`
2. **Manage Rules**: `/alerts/rules/`
3. **Dashboard Link**: The dashboard already has an "Alertes" button

## 🔗 Integration with Existing System

- **Models**: Uses existing Router and User models
- **Metrics**: Integrates with API endpoint for latest metrics
- **Styling**: Matches dashboard and settings app design
- **Authentication**: Requires login for all alert functions
- **Admin**: Full Django admin integration for management

## 🎨 Visual Consistency

The alerts app follows the exact same visual style as other apps:
- Orange theme (#ff6b35)
- Dark background (#1a0f0f)
- Card-based layouts
- Bootstrap-style buttons and forms
- Consistent navigation and headers

This creates a seamless user experience across the entire application.

## 🔒 Security Features

- All views require user authentication (`@login_required`)
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Proper input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection through Django ORM
